# URLs Redirector for WHMCS
The URL redirector will redirect any page on WHMCS to a specific URL of your choice. I developed this module for our website to redirect old URL to a new URL. It came to my mind to release this as a project for all WHMCS users

## Features
- Redirect WHMCS pages to any page
- Set redirect time
- Disable page redirection
## Compatibility
WHMCS v7.0 > WHMCS v8.11
